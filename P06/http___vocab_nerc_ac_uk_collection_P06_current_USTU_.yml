    original: "Standardised scale for nephelometric measurement of turbidity calibrated against formazine solutions of different concentration and measured using a white light source at a 90 degree detection angle. Earlier measurements of turbidity tended to use NTU (sometimes also labelled STU or FTU) as the unit regardless of the measurement method."
