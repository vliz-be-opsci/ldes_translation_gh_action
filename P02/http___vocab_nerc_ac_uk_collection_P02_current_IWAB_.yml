    original: "Insect (Class Insecta) and earthworm (Subclass Oligochaeta) abundance per unit area of bed (sea, river, lake etc.) parameters presented at the level of taxa that may be mapped to entities in a standard taxonomy registry such as WoRMS or ITIS.  Includes animals normally considered as planktonic if they have been returned from sediment samples. This parameter group has been implemented to separate predominantly freshwater taxa from predominantly marine taxa."
