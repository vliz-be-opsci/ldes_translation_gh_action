    original: "Concentrations of inorganic carbon in the particulate phase of the water column as extracted by a fitration technique.  This is the particle-bound concentration per unit volume of the water column. Consequently, it is both a function of the SPM concentration in the water column and the concentration of inorganic carbon per unit weight of the SPM."
