    original: "Concentration parameters for trace metalloid elements and non-organic selenium species in the dissolved phase of any body of fresh or salt water. This may include a contribution from the particulate phase if this has not been totally removed by filtration and the metalloid in question is reactive (ie detected as if it were dissolved) to the analytical technique used. Trace metalloids are considered as B, Ge, As, Sb, Te, and Po (but not Si which is classed separately because of its major role in environmental chemistry)."
